**What is this madness?**

Micromeet lets you quickly generate lots of small meetings
-- a.k.a., *"micromeetings"* -- instead of one large meeting.

**Why?**

If you have the good fortune to be part of an organization that
regularly schedules numerous and extraordinarily long meetings, then you
know that scheduling conflicts, distractions, and personal interruptions
are inevitable.

Rather than schedule one long meeting, Micromeet helpfully lets you
create a contiguous block of *micromeetings* in 10 second increments.

For example, rather than schedule one two-hour meeting, you might use
Micromeet to create a much more convenient block of 120 *micromeetings*
in 30 second increments.

**Why??!?!??**

This allows your enthusiastic attendees to opt out of these
*micromeetings* for important activities such as:

* bathroom breaks
* taking phone calls
* browsing reddit or facebook
* contemplating the futility of existence
* updating their resume

**I'm sold! How do I utilize this innovative tool?**

You can access Micromeet online at the following URL:

Alternatively, you can clone the GitHub repository and host Micromeet on
an internal server, or even run it on your own computer.
